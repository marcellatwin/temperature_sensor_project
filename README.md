# Background

This started as a request from a family member (henceforth named as "the customer") to create a temperature sensor that instead of showing the temperature value, it will show a drink that is matched with specific temperature ranges.

This project is here to accomplish 3 main goals:
 - To learn a new coding language (python) as well as object-oriented coding
 - To create a product from gradle to grave and learn all the associated aspects along the way (hardware selection, wiring, interfacing with the customer, etc.)
 - To build out code to use in later project that I know I will need (data logging, GUI, remote access, etc.)

The table of drinks for certain temperatures was made by the customer and not me.  Also the drinks are in Norwegian so not all the characters will make sense.

I hope to build this out over time with documentation that is clear and professtional looking.  Should anyone ever look at this code, they can learn from it, or better yet, actually use it.

# Equipment

- Raspberry Pi 3 (later swtich to Pi Zero W)
- blah blah temperature sensor (later switch to a water proof sensor as this will live outside)
